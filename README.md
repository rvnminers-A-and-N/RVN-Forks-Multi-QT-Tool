# RVN-and-Forks-Multi-QT-Tool

### Supported Coins
	This was a tool in which I felt was useful for the installation and running of multiple QT wallets at once, based around RVN and its forks! Currently the tool supports the following forks:
	Ravencoin (RVN)
	Ritocoin (RITO)
	Pigeoncoin (PGN)
	Raptoreum (RTM)
	Avian (AVN)

### Run the qt-installer first, then the qt-run!!!

### User Specific Necessesary Tweaks!!!
	Find each your_user_here line of each directory pathway and specify your appropriate user based on your system specification!
	
	The Wallet directory can also be modified in the following lines:
	
	:MAKE_DIR
	ECHO MAKING WALLET DIRECTORY...
	mkdir C:\Users\your_user_here\Desktop\Wallets
	ECHO WALLET DIRETCORY MADE!
	GOTO RVN

	Change the \Desktop\Wallets line to whatever you like, however... 
	you MUST update this directory across all calls to it in both batch files when doing this!

# The tool currently is just windows batch script based and revolves around two modules; the qt-installer and the qt-run modules! There are plans to release Linux/MacOS/RPi versions very soon! Also plans for an eventual non-CMD based, GUI experience, all of which will be contained to one window with multiple tabs for each coin; at least this is the first vision!
